=========================================================================
- Fan and artist actually users they act not like admin who have access or permission to manage whole things
- Fan and artist are the same. Different thing is fan cannot upload a songs but artist can
- I need 2 different accounts. However, both account types have different login credentials, besides that fans and artists can be multi users such as multi-buyers/multi-sellers

Suggestions that im looking for as a reference:
1. Use the same users table to store buyer/seller information
2. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5mRpvjve-E upload music file laravel
3. just create 2 different login form
